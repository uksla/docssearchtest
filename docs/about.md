## What is Lunacy

Lunacy is a Windows app for graphical design with **full support for .sketch files**. And when we say *full* support, we really mean it.

Yes, there are a few apps in the market that allow you to open .sketch files, but none of them can guarantee at least 80% rendering accuracy. Lunacy guarantees 99%. Irrespective of the the format version! Lunacy readily handles both dusty kits from Sketchappsources and the latest versions of sketch files.

Moreover, none of those apps allows you to edit a sketch project and save it back to a .sketch file. Except for Lunacy.

Born as a viewer of sketch files, Lunacy has developed into a fully-functional design app. <!--It inherits all the best things available in Sketch and brings new unique functionality.--> The idea behind the app is to let users focus on what's going on on the canvas rather than fussing around the right panel.

Another important thing about Lunacy is that it is **totally**, **absolutely**, **100% free**. No locked features, no ads.
